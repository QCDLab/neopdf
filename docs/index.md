`NeoPDF` is a fast, reliable, and scalable interpolation library for both **Collinear** Parton
Distribution Functions (PDFs) and **Transverse Momentum Dependent** Distributions (TMDs) with
**modern features**, designed for both present and future hadron collider experiments. It aims
to be a modern, high-performance alternative to both [LHAPDF](https://www.lhapdf.org/) and
[TMDlib](https://tmdlib.hepforge.org/), focusing on:

## Motivation

The need for a fast and reliable PDF interpolation is critical in high-energy physics, especially
for precision calculations at hadron colliders. Existing solutions like LHAPDF or TMDlib, while
widely used, have limitations in terms of extensibility and features. `NeoPDF` addresses these by:

- Providing a modern, modular codebase.
- Enabling easy integration into new and existing workflows.
- Supporting advanced features such as multi-dimensional interpolations.

## High-Level Architecture

- **Core Library (Rust)**: Implements all the interpolation logics, grid management, and PDF
    metadata handling.
- **FFI Bindings**: Exposes the core functionalities to Python, Fortran, C, and C++, enabling
    easier interoperability with other codes that can link to these programming languages.
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities that allow users to inspect the contents of a gird,
    convert LHAPDF/TMDlib format into `NeoPDF`, and perform interpolations.
